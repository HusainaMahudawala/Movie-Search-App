# Movie-Search-App

The Movie Search App is a dynamic web application built using React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and React Toastify. This app allows users to search for movies by title and explore detailed information about each movie.

When a user enters a movie name in the search bar, the app fetches and displays a list of matching movies. Each result includes a movie poster and title. Upon clicking a specific movie, the app navigates to a detailed view that shows the movieâ€™s description, release year, genre, actors, and more. Toast notifications are also used to enhance user interaction, providing feedback for actions like errors or empty searches.

This project demonstrates how to consume APIs, manage routing in React, and create a responsive, visually appealing UI using Tailwind CSS.
